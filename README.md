From the Kaggle website there are published datasets from the real world, one of them is the Household Electric Power Consumption dataset which has the record of the energy consumption of a house over a period of more than 3 years. We built a software system that an analyst can use to make inferences about energy consumption over time. For example, (a) what period of the day is the consumption of the laundry room maximum? (b) which period of the year / which month is the minimum / maximum heating consumption? (c) the energy consumption in the kitchen changes depending on the day of the week; Because we have measurements per second we are interested in statistics such as (a) sum or (b) average consumption price per time period.

System operation: the system first loads the file from which we want to check the energy consumption, then we specify the statistics we want to produce and after running the program, a report is produced with the extracted results.
